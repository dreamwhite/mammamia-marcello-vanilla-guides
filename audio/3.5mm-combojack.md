## Requirements

* [CodecCommander](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-eapd-codec-commander/downloads/RehabMan-CodecCommander-2018-1003.zip)
  * includes hda-verb
* Codec name
  * from previous page [AppleALC](applealc.md)
* [Mount EFI](../bootloaders/mount-efi.md)
* Clover
  * AudioDxe.efi
* [ALCPlugFix](https://github.com/goodwin/ALCPlugFix)

### Step 1: installing Codec Commander and hda-verb

{% hint style="warning" %}
Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, file system structure has changed and is splitted in two partitions: one for operating system which is read-only, and one for user data.

Mount the root partition in read and write mode with the following command:
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo mount -uw /
```

Download Codec Commander kext and place it in `ECKO`. Then place `hda-verb` inside `/usr/bin`. Reboot and proceed to **Step 2**.

### Step 2: dumping codec from Clover

Download AudioDxe.efi and place it in `ECDU` or `ECDB` while in Clover boot screen press `F8` \(or `Fn+F8` if you have `Fn keys` swapped\)

Mount EFI and then open `ECM` . You'll find some .txt file.

### Step 3: analyze codec dump

![Figure 2: Codec name Realtek ALC3254 aka ALC295](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2840%29.png)

By scrolling the txt file you'll find something as depicted below

![Figure 3: Node 0x12 Pin Complex](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2849%29.png)

Example:

```text
Node 0x12 [Pin Complex] wcaps 0x40040b: Stereo Amp-In
  Control: name="Internal Mic Boost Volume", index=0, device=0
    ControlAmp: chs=3, dir=In, idx=0, ofs=0
  Amp-In caps: ofs=0x00, nsteps=0x03, stepsize=0x27, mute=0
  Amp-In vals:  [0x00 0x00]
  Pincap 0x00000020: IN
  Pin Default 0xb7a60130: [Fixed] Mic at Oth Mobile-In
    Conn = Digital, Color = Unknown
    DefAssociation = 0x3, Sequence = 0x0
    Misc = NO_PRESENCE
  Pin-ctls: 0x20: IN
  Power states:  D0 D1 D2 D3 EPSS
  Power: setting=D0, actual=D0
```

**Node: `0x12`  
Name:** `Internal Mic Boost Volume`  
**Pin-ctls:** `0x20` _\*\*_

Look for `Headset Mic Boost Volume` and `Headphone Mic Boost Volume`and note `Node` and `Pin-ctls`.

For my ALC295 I have the following `Pin Complex` for `Headset Mic Boost Volume`:

```text
Node 0x19 [Pin Complex] wcaps 0x40048b: Stereo Amp-In
  Control: name="Headset Mic Boost Volume", index=0, device=0
    ControlAmp: chs=3, dir=In, idx=0, ofs=0
  Amp-In caps: ofs=0x00, nsteps=0x03, stepsize=0x27, mute=0
  Amp-In vals:  [0x00 0x00]
  Pincap 0x00003724: IN Detect
    Vref caps: HIZ 50 GRD 80 100
  Pin Default 0x411111f0: [N/A] Speaker at Ext Rear
    Conn = 1/8, Color = Black
    DefAssociation = 0xf, Sequence = 0x0
    Misc = NO_PRESENCE
  Pin-ctls: 0x24: IN VREF_80
  Unsolicited: tag=00, enabled=0
  Power states:  D0 D1 D2 D3 EPSS
  Power: setting=D0, actual=D0
```

and the following `Pin Complex` for `Headphone Mic Boost Volume`:

```text
Node 0x1a [Pin Complex] wcaps 0x40048b: Stereo Amp-In
  Control: name="Headphone Mic Boost Volume", index=0, device=0
    ControlAmp: chs=3, dir=In, idx=0, ofs=0
  Amp-In caps: ofs=0x00, nsteps=0x03, stepsize=0x27, mute=0
  Amp-In vals:  [0x00 0x00]
  Pincap 0x00003724: IN Detect
    Vref caps: HIZ 50 GRD 80 100
  Pin Default 0x411111f0: [N/A] Speaker at Ext Rear
    Conn = 1/8, Color = Black
    DefAssociation = 0xf, Sequence = 0x0
    Misc = NO_PRESENCE
  Pin-ctls: 0x20: IN VREF_HIZ
  Unsolicited: tag=00, enabled=0
  Power states:  D0 D1 D2 D3 EPSS
  Power: setting=D0, actual=D0
```

What we need to to is telling to our audio codec that the Node `0x19` has `0x24` as Pin-ctls.

According to [hda\_verb.h](https://github.com/digitalocean/linux-coresched/blob/master/include/sound/hda_verbs.h), `AC_VERB_SET_PIN_WIDGET_CONTROL` can be shortened with `0x707`.

So inside a terminal window type

```text
hda-verb 0x19 0x707 0x24

          /\          /\
          ||          ||
          ||          ||
     Replace with     Replace with 
      your node       your Pin-Ctls
```

You will notice that switching from speakers to headphone won't produce more white noise or distorted sound. Now let's make this fix permanent

### Step 4: creating the daemon

Without a daemon, every time you plug/unplug your headphones you need to retype the same command and this is frustrating. Here comes ALCPlugFix, which is a background process that will do the work for us:

Download ALCPlugFix and open `ALCPlugFix.xcodeproj` file.

![Figure 4: open ALCPlugFix.xcodeproj](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

![Figure 5: click on open](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

![Figure 6: open main.m](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2839%29.png)

On line `109` , `120` and `125`replace `0x18` and `0x20` with your `Node` and `Pin-ctls` previously found.

So it will be something as:

```text
hda-verb 0x19 0x707 0x20
```

and repeat the same step for node `0x1a` on lines `110` ,`121` and `126`.

After finishing build the project and build with `Command+B` or from top menu under `Product`

![Figure 7: Build project](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

![Figure 8: successfully build project](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

Then expand from left sidebar `Products` folder, right click on `ALCPlugFix` and click on `Show in Finder`.

![Figure 9: expand Products folder](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2838%29.png)

![Figure 10: show in Finder ALCPlugFix exec](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

![Figure 11: ALCPlugFix exec ](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

Replace `ALCPlugFix` in `alc_fix` folder with the one built before as depicted in `Figure 1` .

![Figure 12: alc\_fix folder](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

![Figure 13: replace file](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2850%29.png)

![Figure 14: replaced ALCPlugFix exec](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

### Step 5: install the daemon

Open a terminal window and `cd` inside the `ALCPlugFix` folder, and execute `install.sh`

![Figure 15: install daemon](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

### Uninstall

According to `install.sh` the following files are copied inside the file-system:

1. `ALCPlugFix` in `/usr/bin`
2. `hda-verb` in `/usr/bin` 
3. `good.win.ALCPlugFix.plist` inside `/Library/LaunchAgents`

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

For removing `ALCPlugFix` :

```bash
sudo rm /usr/bin/hda-verb
sudo rm /usr/bin/ALCPlugFix
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/good.win.ALCPlugFix.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/good.win.ALCPlugFix.plist
```

Then reboot

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't extract ACPI tables using MaciASL or DPCIManager as they are already patched using DSDT with Clover/Opencore renames
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: identifying keyboard combination

While on Clover boot screen press F1 to open Help Menu

![If this menu doesn&apos;t open repeat the procedure using fn+F1](../.gitbook/assets/image-3.png)

In the first case **F1**will call the standard **F1** key, else it will be **fn+F1**

### Step 2: extract ACPI tables

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following procedure is a background process, so don't expect any graphical output
{% endhint %}

Press **F4** \(or **fn+F4** if the fn keys are swapped\) and wait 30 seconds before booting

Then boot and after mounting the EFI open ACPI/origin folder

# CPU

In order to remove unused processors from IORegistryExplorer you need to know how many cores/threads does your CPU have \(e.g. 4/8 cpu/thread cpu will have `PR00-PR07` entries in IORegistryExplorer

## Requirements:

* Core/Threads of your CPU
* DSDT.aml cleaned from errors
  * [Extracting ACPI tables](../extracting-acpi-tables.md)
* [MaciASL](../../tools/useful-tools/maciasl.md)
* [IORegistryExplorer](../../tools/debugging/ioregistryexplorer.md)
